Order Number    Book Title and Author              Quantity     Price per Item

Write a Python program, which returns a list with 2-tuples. Each tuple consists of a the order number and the product of the price per items and the quantity. The product should be increased by 10,- € if the value of the order is smaller than 100,00 €.
Write a Python program using lambda and map.


2) The same bookshop, but this time we work on a different list. The sublists of our lists look like this: [ordernumber, (article number, quantity, price per unit), ... (article number, quantity, price per unit) ] Write a program which returns a list of two tuples with (order number, total amount of order).
